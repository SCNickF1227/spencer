**_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________**

**TL;DR**

**This script was written to identify issues which may otherwise be silent, as they are not reported by the built-in TrueNAS Alert system nor in some 3rd party community scripts like [@joeschmuck](https://www.truenas.com/community/members/joeschmuck.101/)'s Multi-Report.**

https://www.truenas.com/community/resources/multi_report-sh-version-for-core-and-scale.179/updates

**This script works with both CORE and SCALE.**

**Due to a change in logging on SCALE Cobia, this script will not work on versions newer than 22.12.x!**

**I will update it when I am able.**

üçç **"Spencer Reports"** üçç

**[I Know, You Know](https://psychusa.fandom.com/wiki/I_Know,_You_Know)**

Okay, Gus, listen up! This isn't your grandmother's script, it's the "Spencer" script! You know, named after me, **the** Shawn Spencer. It's got that psychic detective edge.

You see, first, it's got this fancy thing where it talks to the spirits ‚Äì or a JSON file, but who's keeping track ‚Äì and figures out what errors it's seen before. I like to think of it as the script's own little psychic vision.

Then, it gets down to business, checking out the current scene (or, you know, the logs) and finding any new mysterious events that occurred. If there's something fishy, like there's no new errors but old ones are lurking around, it's going to shout out loud with our **"PREVIOUS ERROR"** alert. If everything's hunky-dory, then it celebrates with a joyful **"SUCCESS"** note. And if there are any new secrets unveiled, it'll don the **"ERROR"** hat.

Now, what's cooler is this script doesn't just stop at identifying these errors. Oh no! It dresses them up real nice and presents them like I present clues. And of course, it won't leave you hanging. It provides all the juicy details about each error, including a super intense description and how many times that sneaky error appeared.

Oh, and just in case you're super curious, it will also tell you the exact time and place (or you know, log entry) where the error made its appearance.

And when all is said and done, it makes sure to remember all the new mysteries it encountered for next time. Kinda like my **"remember that for later"** moments.

So, in a nutshell: this script is like me if I were a bunch of code, always on the lookout for errors and doing it with style. And pineapples. Definitely with pineapples.

  * *"Failed Reading Romances"*: I feel this on a spiritual level.
  * *"Write Wrongs"*: It's like a typo, but more dramatic.
  * *"ATA Bus Stops"*: Where does it even go?
  * *"Exceptional Exceptions"*: Because even errors are special.
  * *"ACPI's Moods"*: Sometimes it's upset, sometimes it's just warning you.
* **Low-Level Lightheartedness**:
  * *"ACPI Chuckles"*: More of a snicker, really.

******End of Spencer's Spectacular List!******

And remember, when things go sideways, always keep a pineapple handy. Oh, and maybe a technician. But mostly the pineapple.

<center><h2><font color="red">Guide to Mastering the Mysteries Within üîÆ</font></h2></center>

<p><font size="4">Hi there, seeker of knowledge! It's me, Gus, your friendly, quirky guide to the complex, yet incredibly powerful, world of the Spencer Script.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">If you've got a moment (or several), let's dive deep into the abyss of this code.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Oh, and always remember: <i>"Read the manual, but with flair!"</i></font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4">üì¨ <b>1. Email Setup - Your First Port of Call</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Customizing the Recipient Address:</strong></font><br>
<em>Seek and you shall find the line:</em> <code>DEFAULT_RECIPIENT = "YourEmail Address.com"</code>. It's practically calling out for you!<br>
Replace <code>"YourEmail Address.com"</code> with the target email address of your choosing. This will direct Spencer's precious messages straight into their virtual arms.</p>

<p><font size="4">üîç <b>2. Dive into The Configurations</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Using Multi-Report:</strong></font><br>
The line <code>use_multireport = True</code> decides if you want the outputs in a multi-report (writing to a file) or sent as an email. Adjust as you see fit.</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Command Line Extraordinaire:</strong></font><br>
If you invoke this script with command line arguments, make sure you know about the <code>USE_WITH_MULTI_REPORT</code> line. If you add 'multi_report' as the argument when you call the script, Spencer switches to multi-report mode. Neat, right?</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Subject Lines & The Emailing Game:</strong></font><br>
Various subject lines are predefined (<code>ERROR_SUBJECT</code>, <code>SUCCESS_SUBJECT</code>, and <code>PREV_ERROR_SUBJECT</code>). They include the hostname dynamically. You can modify these if you fancy a change in your notifications.</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>File Locations for the Knowledge Seeker:</strong></font><br>
<code>ERRORS_FILE</code> & <code>CONTENT_FILE</code>: Spencer has designated spots to store previous errors and report content. Tread carefully and adjust if you have specific paths in mind.</p>

<p><font size="4">ü§ñ <b>3. Patterns & Errors - The Heart and Soul</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Behold! Predefined error patterns tailored for Linux (TrueNAS SCALE) & FreeBSD (TrueNAS CORE).</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Each pattern is categorized by severity (High, Moderate, Low).</strong></font> But hey, remember, it's not the size of the error, but how you handle it!</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Deciphering The Pattern:</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>For the brave-hearted, here's a breakdown of the pattern anatomy:</strong></font></p>
<p><strong>Main Term:</strong> e.g., <code>("nfs:", ["Stale file handle"], [], "nfs_stale")</code>.<br>
<strong>Positive Matches:</strong> These are keywords or phrases Spencer seeks.<br>
<strong>Negative Matches:</strong> Keywords that, if present, will exclude the log line.<br>
<strong>Pattern Key:</strong> A unique identifier for each pattern.</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Severity Levels & Descriptions:</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Deep within, you'll find <code>SEVERITIES</code> which categorizes each error by its impact.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong><code>ERROR_DESCRIPTIONS</code> gives a detailed breakdown of each error.</strong></font> So next time an error comes knocking, you'll be ready with an answer.</p>

<p><font size="4">üí° <b>Pro Tips:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Avoid swimming in the deep end without your floaties!</strong></font> Changes to the error patterns and descriptions can have ripple effects. Test after modifications.</p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Keep backups!</strong></font> It's not magic; it's just common sense. Before making major changes, keep a copy of the original script.</p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Have fun!</strong></font> Coding is an art, and you're the artist. Enjoy the process.</p>

<p><font size="4">Remember, every journey with code is a chance to learn, grow, and possibly break a few things.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">But isn't that the fun of it all?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">So go on, adventurer, and make this script your own!</font></p>
<p><font size="4">And, as always, <i>"Read the manual!"</i>... but, ya know, with a pinch of panache.</font></p>

<br>

<p><font size="4">Fare thee well!</font></p>
